# Spam-Email-DEtection
It is one of my minor project which not only gave me new vision towards evolving cybersecurity field but tells how Emails are being part of many attacks. Email is one of our daily activities or better to say one of our part without which any professionalism cannot be achieved, maybe it has a small part of contribution in our life still avoiding it can result in critical and sensitive data explosure.
Use of the model can be implemented by training of both RetVec(Resilient and Effective vectorizer) and Tesseract model. These models are originally made and implemented by google yet they are facing challenges to avoid spam email. So from my side i have just change the way of identifying emails which is implemented in meta model, combination of both the models.
